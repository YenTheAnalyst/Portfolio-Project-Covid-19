-- 1. 
-- GLOBAL NUMBERS

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as float)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as float))/SUM(cast(New_Cases as float))*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
where continent is not null 
order by 1,2


-- Just a double check based off the data provided

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as float)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as float))/SUM(cast(New_Cases as float))*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
where location = 'World'
order by 1,2

-- numbers are extremely close so we will keep them 


-- 2. 
-- We take these out as they are not inluded in the above queries and want to stay consistent
-- European Union is part of Europe

Select location, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- Just a double check based off the data provided

Select location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc

-- numbers are perfectly close so we will keep them 


-- 3.

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max(total_cases)/population*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- Just a double check based off the data provided

Select Location, Population, Sum(cast(new_cases as float)) as HighestInfectionCount,  Sum(cast(new_cases as float))/population*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null
